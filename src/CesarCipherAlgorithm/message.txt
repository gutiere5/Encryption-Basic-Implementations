This is a top secret message intended for the Java encryption test.
The primary objective is to validate the efficacy of the Caeser cipher algorithm currently under development.
We must ensure that the encryption and decryption processes are perfectly symmetrical.
This means that a message encrypted with a specific key, when decrypted with the same key, must return the original plaintext data exactly,
without any loss or alteration of characters, including whitespace and punctuation. This test will involve multiple keys, ranging from 1 to 6.
Subsequent tests will need to explore edge cases, such as handling wrap-around for characters at the end of the ASCII table and processing non-alphabetic symbols.
All results must be logged. This operation is classified.
